You and your K-1 friends want to buy N flowers. Flower number i has cost ci. Unfortunately the seller does not like a customer to buy a lot of flowers, so he tries to change the price of flowers for customer who had bought flowers before. More precisely if a customer has already bought x flowers, he should pay (x+1)*ci dollars to buy flower number i.
You and your K-1 friends want to buy all N flowers in such a way that you spend the least amount of money possible. You can buy the flowers in any order.

Input:

The first line of input contains two integers N and K (K <= N) next line contains N positive integers c1,c2,â€¦,cN respectively.

Output:

Print the minimum amount of money you (and your friends) have to pay in order to buy all N flowers.

Sample input :

3 3
2 5 6

Sample output :

13

Explanation :
In the example each of you and your friends should buy one flower. in this case you have to pay 13 dollars.

Constraint :

1 <= N, K  <= 100
Each ci is not more than 1,000,000
